# Command Line Shell Basics

## Introduction

This tutorial introduces basic interaction with Unix-style command line shells such as Bash (although the concepts introduced here will also be useful in Windows Powershell).  By the end of the tutorial you should understand how to run commands in a shell, and you should be able to use a shell to navigate, inspect, and manipulate a file system.

## What is a Shell?

A shell is a user interface that allows a person to interact with a computer operating system such as Windows, MacOS, or Linux.  Some shells have a Graphical User Interface (GUI), but many have a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) into which the user may type commands that the operating system will then execute.  Commands may or may not produce text output that is also presented in the CLI.

> ##### Shell vs Console vs Terminal
> The terms `console` and `terminal` are often used interchangeably with the term `shell`.  For this tutorial that is all you need to know, but there are technically some differences between the three concepts.  You can read more in [this StackExchange answer](https://superuser.com/a/144668) if you are interested.

### Examples of Command Line Shells

There are many CLI shells available, but the table below lists the ones you will encounter most often in a typical computer environment.

| Shell Name | Environment |
|------------|------------------|
| bash       | MacOS or Linux terminal |
| cmd | Windows |
| Git Bash | Packaged with git on Windows |
| PowerShell | Windows |
| zsh        | Linux terminal |

> ##### Note
> This tutorial focuses on Unix-style shells, which all support a common set of commands.  Git Bash, bash, and zsh are all Unix-style shells.  If you are on a Windows device, you should be able to follow along in this tutorial using Git Bash.  If you are using PowerShell, see [this reference](files/PowerShell-equivalents-for-common-linux-commands.pdf) of PowerShell equivalents for common bash commands.

### Learning to use CLI Shells is Important

A CLI shell is one of the primary tools used by programmers to inspect and configure the devices they are working on, so it is important for you as a budding programmer to get comfortable with using one.

## The Interface

A typical CLI shell session involves entering a sequence of text commands into the shell to either obtain some information about the user's system, or alter some aspect of the user's system, or both.

#### Sample CLI session

```bash
> cd ~
> ls
file1.txt file2.txt
> mkdir newfolder
> ls
file1.txt file2.txt newfolder
> cd newfolder
> touch newfile.txt
> ls
newfile.txt
```

When a shell session begins, the user is usually given a prompt which which may be a simple symbol like `>` or `$` but often contains some information about the environment that the shell is runing in.

The user may then type a command, followed by the `enter` or `return` key to submit that command to the shell, at which point the command is executed, and any output generated by the command is displayed in the shell.

After a command has finished executing, the shell once again displays the prompt and the process can repeat.

With this simple usage pattern, you can examine and manipulate almost any aspect of your computer system if you know the right commands!

> ##### Note
> Your shell will probably show a different prompt than the ones you see in this tutorial, but the usage pattern will be the same.

### Basic Command Syntax

Commands in a shell usually follow a typical format:  the name of a command, followed by zero or more options, followed by zero or more arguments.

For example,

```bash
ls -a /Users/ali
```

is a command that lists the contents of the directory `/Users/ali`, including hidden files.  The name of the command is `ls`.  The option `-a` causes the `ls` command to include hidden files in its output.  Finally, the argument `/Users/ali` is the directory for which the contents are to be listed.

> ##### Note
> You may notice the use of terms inside of angle brackets in the documentation for command line tools, a as in `ls <pathname>`. The angle-bracketed terms are usually placeholders describing what you should *actually* type when using the command.  You should *not* include the angle brackets in an actual command.  For example, `ls </Users/ali>` would be an incorrect interpretation of the previous documentation; `ls /Users/ali` would be correct.

Many commands can be used without any options or arguments at all.  For example, the command `ls` by itself simply lists all non-hidden files and directories in the current working directory.  (Don't worry if you don't understand the term "working directory". We will define that soon!)

### Command Arguments

The "argument(s)" of a command are usually used to specify the thing(s) that the command will operate on.  Very often, the arguments are file or directory names, but arguments may also refer to other kinds of objects depending on the command.

### Command Options

Most commands have many options that allow the user to adjust the output or behaviour of the command in some way.  Options can often be specified in one of two ways: a one-letter flag that begins with a single hyphen `-`, or an equivalent long-form name that begins with two hyphens `--`.

For example, the above command could also have been written as

```bash
ls --all /Users/ali
```

> ##### NOTE
> Depending on your platform, the `ls` command may not support the long-form options

Long-form option names are usually more descriptive and easier to remember, but you will want to learn the most common short forms for the most common commands to make typing the commands quicker.

#### Multiple Options

Multiple options may usually be specified at once.  The command below lists all the files in `/Users/ali`, including hidden files (via the `--all` option), with one file per line in the output (via the `-1` option).

```bash
ls --all -1 /Users/ali
```

#### Order of Options

The order of options *usually* does not matter.  The command below does the same thing as the one above.

```bash
ls -1 --all /Users/ali
```

Note that we have mixed the use of short and long-form option names.  The command could of course also be using only short form options:

```bash
ls -a -1 /Users/ali
```

#### Multiple Short Form Options

When multiple short form options are specified, they can be combined using a single hyphen followed immediately by all the short form options, as in

```bash
ls -a1 /Users/ali
```

#### Parameterized Options

Some options may accept parameters.  For example, the `--sort` option of the `ls` command can be set to `size` or `time` to sort the results accordingly, like this:

```bash
ls --sort=size /Users/ali
```

Of course, the two versions of the `--sort` option indicated above have short forms: `-S` and `-t`, respectively, so the above command could also be written as

```bash
ls -S /Users/ali
```

## Getting Information About Commands

Most commands come with extensive documentation in a "manual page" that can be viewed using the `man` (short for "manual") command.

For example, the command below prints out the manual page for the `ls` command.

```bash
man ls
```

> ##### Note
> Unfortunately, Git Bash does not include manual pages, but you can view the manuals for most commands on [this website](https://linux.die.net/man/).

> ##### Note
> Manual pages can be quite long, and some shells will allow you to move up and down within the text using the `j` and `k` keys, respectively. You can also exit the manual page before you reach the end by typing `q` (for quit).

The `whatis` command can be used to print a short description of other commands.

Many commands also have a `--help` option that prints a short message describing the command and its most common usages.

It is often important to know which version of a command is on your system, which most commands will display when run with the `--version` option.

## File System Navigation & Manipulation

From this point on you should have a shell open on your computer and follow along by entering the commands into your shell.

### The Working Directory

Every shell command is executed in the context of a **working directory**.  You can print the current working directory using the `pwd` command:

```bash
> pwd
/Users/ali
```

The output of the `pwd` command is the directory in which the shell is currently operating.  Any commands that manipulate files will do so relative to this directory unless otherwise specified in the command.

### Changing the Working Directory

You can change the working directory using the `cd` command followed by a path to a directory.  (`cd` is short for "change directory")

For example, the command `cd /` changes the working directory to the root directory of the file system.

### Paths

A path describes the set of directories that must be opened to get to some descendant directory.

For example, suppose the 

```
    /
    +-- www/ 
    |   +-- images/
    |   |   +-- logo.png
    |   |   +-- mugshot.jpg
    |   |
    |   +-- about/
    |   |   +- index.html
    |   |
    |   +- index.html
    |
    +-- Users/ 
        +- ali/
```

#### Absolute Paths

#### Relative Paths

#### The User Home Directory
